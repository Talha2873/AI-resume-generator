      " My name is Ali Raza, and I‚Äôm from Karachi, Pakistan. I completed my Bachelor‚Äôs in Data Science at NED University in 2022. During my studies, I worked on a final-year project where I developed a machine learning model to predict stock market trends using Python, Pandas, and Scikit-learn. After graduation, I joined a startup called DataWorks as a Data Analyst. I worked there for 1 year (2022‚Äì2023). My main responsibilities included cleaning large datasets, creating dashboards in Power BI, and building predictive models for customer behavior. One of my achievements was improving the accuracy of a customer churn model by 15%. In 2023, I moved to a company called TechVision as a Junior Machine Learning Engineer. Here, I developed and deployed NLP models for sentiment analysis of product reviews. I also worked with cloud platforms like AWS to host machine learning services. Apart from my jobs, I‚Äôve done freelancing on Fiverr, where I helped small businesses with data cleaning, Excel automation, and building simple dashboards. My technical skills include Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, SQL, Power BI, and AWS. I also have good problem-solving and communication skills. In my free time, I contribute to open-source projects on GitHub and write blogs about data science.\n"
